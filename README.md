> NovariaOS is an experimental operating system whose architecture challenges traditional approaches. It is built on the concept of an microkernel.

## Features

*   **NVM (Novaria Virtual Machine):** Safely executes bytecode within an isolated environment.
*   **CAPS (CAPabilities):** A unique rights management system that controls and manages the permissions of any running process.

## Goals

By the final release, we aim to create a complete and polished system with the following ecosystem:

*   **A Complete Set of System Utilities (Nutils):** A fully functional and coherent set of core utilities for system management that follows the internal logic of NovariaOS rather than inherited conventions.
*   **Programming Language Support:**
    *   A Low-Level Language (e.g., C): For developing system components, drivers, and high-performance applications.
    *   A High-Level Scripting Language (e.g., Python): For automation, rapid development, and user convenience.
*   **Network Stack (Optional but Desirable):** A functional network implementation sufficient for local network communication and, potentially, internet access.
*   **Legendary Stability and Debugging:** The release version must be thoroughly debugged. We strive for a level of stability that will become a hallmark of NovariaOS, inspired by systems like FreeBSD.
*   **A Distinct Niche and Community:** We envision NovariaOS as a respected niche OS — known in its circles, with dedicated followers who appreciate its uniqueness and use it as their primary system if it perfectly suits their needs. Like FreeBSD, NovariaOS should not be a "replacement for anything," but should move in its own deliberately chosen direction.

## Non-Goals

NovariaOS is **not** trying to do these things:

*   **Replacing Mainstream OSes:** NovariaOS does not aim to replace Linux, BSD, Windows, macOS, or any other widely used operating system. We are not striving for world domination.
*   **POSIX Compliance:** We are not a POSIX-compliant operating system. While we may borrow some successful ideas, we are free to design our APIs and system behaviors as we see fit for our architecture.
*   **Following Trends for Trends' Sake:** We will not blindly adopt every new technological fad if it does not align with the project's long-term goals and architecture.
*   **Complete Rejection of Heritage:** We are not "mad scientists" seeking to reinvent absolutely everything. We respect OS history and will use proven concepts when they are the best solution.
