# What is NovariaOS?
NovariaOS is an experimental operating system whose architecture challenges traditional approaches. It is built on the concept of an exokernel but implements it in a unique way.

## Key Principles

### 1. Exokernel and Rejection of Classical LibOS
As in a classical exokernel, the minimal functionality of the NovariaOS kernel provides primitives for resource management. However, we have moved away from the paradigm of multiple library operating systems (LibOS). Instead, NovariaOS uses a single monolithic LibOS that contains the entire userspace.

**Why did we do this?** This avoids the overhead of interaction between multiple LibOS and consolidates system services in one place. Furthermore, the presence of the NVM guarantees fault tolerance: if one component (e.g., a driver) fails with a fatal error, it will not affect the others. Some note the possibility of hot swapping as an important advantage of multiple LibOS, which is theoretically possible in our approach as well, with the involvement of the NVM.

### 2. Fundamental Technologies
- **CAPS (Capability-Based Security)**: The entire security system is built on transferable access rights (capabilities), providing a flexible and powerful protection model.
- **NVM (Novaria Virtual Machine)**: This is the heart of the userspace. Any program, regardless of the programming language, is compiled into NVM bytecode and executed in this environment. This ensures cross-platform compatibility, isolation, and a unified execution model.
