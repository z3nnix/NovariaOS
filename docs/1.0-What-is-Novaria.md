# What is NovariaOS?
NovariaOS is an experimental operating system whose architecture challenges traditional approaches. It is built on the concept of an microkernel.

# Archicture
## 1. Clean microkernel
The kernel provides only basic primitives: memory management, IPC, scheduler. Everything else — drivers, file systems, network stacks — runs in user space as isolated service processes.

## 2. NVM as unified execution environment
Any programme (service or application) is compiled into NVM bytecode and executed in this virtual machine. This provides:
- Portability: true Write Once, Run Anywhere
- Safe: a conditional out-of-bound will not cause panicking.

## 2. Fundamental Technologies
- **CAPS (Capability-Based Security)**: The entire security system is built on transferable access rights (capabilities), providing a flexible and powerful protection model.
- **NVM (Novaria Virtual Machine)**: This is the heart of the userspace. Any program, regardless of the programming language, is compiled into NVM bytecode and executed in this environment. This ensures cross-platform compatibility, isolation, and a unified execution model.
