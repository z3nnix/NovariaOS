# Goals and Non-Goals of NovariaOS

This document defines the philosophy and strategic direction of the NovariaOS project.

### Our Philosophy

NovariaOS is an experimental operating system that follows its own path. We do not aim to blindly follow existing standards, nor do we thoughtlessly reject them. Our approach is that of a **pragmatic experiment**: we reconsider and change only those aspects we are uncertain about, while retaining proven solutions where they work perfectly.

Our ambition is to create not "just another UNIX-like OS", but a cohesive, well-debugged, and stable platform with its own unique ecosystem.

## Goals

By the final release, we aim to create a complete and polished system with the following ecosystem:

1.  **A Complete Set of System Utilities (Nutils):** A fully functional and coherent set of core utilities for system management that follows the internal logic of NovariaOS, rather than inherited conventions.

2.  **Programming Language Support:**
    *   **A Low-Level Language (e.g., C):** For developing system components, drivers, and high-performance applications.
    *   **A High-Level Scripting Language (e.g., Python):** For automation, rapid development, and user convenience.

3.  **Network Stack (Optional, but Desirable):** A functional network implementation sufficient for local network communication and, potentially, internet access.

4.  **Legendary Stability and Debugging:** The release version must be thoroughly debugged. We strive for a level of stability that becomes a hallmark of NovariaOS, inspired by systems like FreeBSD.

5.  **A Distinct Niche and Community:** We envision NovariaOS as a respected niche OS—known in its circles, with dedicated followers who appreciate its uniqueness, and used as a primary system by those whose needs it perfectly meets. Like FreeBSD, NovariaOS should not be a "replacement for anything," but should move in its own, deliberately chosen direction.

## Non-Goals

1.  **Replacing Mainstream OSes:** NovariaOS **does not aim** to replace Linux, BSD, Windows, macOS, or any other widely used operating system. We are not striving for world domination.

2.  **POSIX Compliance:** We **are not** a POSIX-compliant operating system. While we may borrow some successful ideas, we are free to design our APIs and system behaviors as we see fit for our architecture.

3.  **Following Trends for Trend's Sake:** We **will not** blindly adopt every new technological fad if it does not align with the project's long-term goals and architecture.

4.  **Complete Rejection of Heritage:** We **are not** "mad scientists" seeking to reinvent absolutely everything. We respect OS history and will use proven concepts where they are the best solution.
