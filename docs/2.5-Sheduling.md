# Sheduling in Novaria
The Novaria kernel uses a scheduling algorithm based on [Round Robin](https://wiki.osdev.org/Scheduling_Algorithms#Round_Robin).

The kernel starts an endless loop that keeps calling `nvm_scheduler_tick()`. This function runs one bytecode instruction for the current process. Process switching happens every `TIME_SLICE_MS` ticks, moving on to the next active process in a circle.

**Note**: This is a cooperative, instruction-level scheduler rather than a preemptive thread scheduler.
