# Sheduling in Novaria
The Novaria kernel uses a sheduling algorithm called (Round Robbin)[https://wiki.osdev.org/Scheduling_Algorithms#Round_Robin]

The kernel register a function ``pit_polling_loop()`` that CPU calls periodically. This function calls the nvm_scheduler_tick() function, which supports NVM operation. Each call to this function triggers the execution of bytecode. Task switching occurs every ``TIME_SLICE_MS``.

The Novaria kernel uses a scheduling algorithm based on (Round Robin)[https://wiki.osdev.org/Scheduling_Algorithms#Round_Robin].

The kernel runs a polling function `pit_polling_loop()` that continuously checks the PIT timer. When the timer overflows, it calls `nvm_scheduler_tick()`. This function executes one bytecode instruction for the current process. Process switching occurs every `TIME_SLICE_MS` timer ticks, moving to the next active process in a circular manner.

**Note**: This is a cooperative, instruction-level scheduler rather than a preemptive thread scheduler.
