# What is RamFS
RamFS is is a basic file system created to provide the foundation for an operating system. 

# How it works
There are 32 sectors. There are three functions: write(); read(); delete(). 

## write()
Writes the passed string to the first free sector and returns its number. If there are no free sectors, returns ``-1``

## read()
Accepts int as the sector number. Returns the string contained in the sector.

## delete()
Accepts int as the sector number. Clears the sector value.
